<img class="Me_1" src="img/IMG_4281.jpg" /><p>I've recently joined university which has proven to be one of the most interesting experiences of my life thus far, as it has allowed me spend time with a complete mixture of people that I would otherwise not have the opportunity to socialise with. Before coming to university I would spend alot of my time doing art, whether painting, sewing, upholstering or ceramics. This has made me have a real appreciation for the process of making things, hense why I have taken an interst in setting up my own website and posting blogs on it.</p>

		<p>I love spending alot of time with my family, even though we don't always get on. I suppose that imperfection is what I love most, as you have such a mixture of characters all bunched up, yet our love for eachother glues us together. This photo is from my Dad's birthday tea when he got given his cake. It was a lovely moments that I was happen to capture. Moments like that are what I live for with my family!</p>
